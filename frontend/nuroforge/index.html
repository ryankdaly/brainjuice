    <h2>Our Projects:</h2>
    <p class="dept">
        <a href="https://github.com/ryankdaly/hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> - hobgoblin is a custom C++ video game engine being built from scratch. hobgoblin is specifically built and heavily optimized for determinism first simulations. Strict data oriented design and predictable memory usage are key. Realtime 3d rendering, fixed timestep, zero allocation hot paths, custom ecs and system scheduling, physics lite queries, hot reloadable assets, are a few more of the essential engine features. All of these features combined plus more provide high performance and scalability, with multiplayer in mind. Please see github for more info and features. This project will always be free and open source. Extensive documentation and tutorials are to be included. However, the game goblin_kingdom will not be free, though it will be available at a low price ($6.66 USD) with no subscriptions nor microtransactions ever to be included.

        <a href="https://github.com/ryankdaly/pulpnet">pulpnet</a> at <a href="https://pulpjuice.net">pulpjuice.net</a> - pulpnet is an attempt to revive pulp fiction, but in a secure, simple, and accessible way. The WIP website intends to provide an anonymous Internet space for writers around the world to share pulp fiction. Anonymity is a key feature, the goal is for all users to be shrouded by a pen name. Users can write stories, but also include images with intuitive built-in text wrapping. Further, users can choose to publish their works for others to read and enjoy. A voting system will be implemented, which will allow users to vote for their favorite stories to be featured in a monthly issued e-magazine. Many more features to follow.
