# BrainJuice - WIP
[brainjuice.studio](https://brainjuice.studio)  
open source repository and documentation of **brainjuice.studio**'s web infrastructure for demonstration purposes   
**!under construction!**  
currently using **cloudflare** for domain registration and static hosting  
you will get a **DNS record** error upon website, specifcally 1016, this is intentional  
our **DNS records** are properly configured **except** the **AAAA record** and hosting configuration, this is in the process and should be finished soon  
static hosting is using **cloudflare pages**  
**brainjuice.studio**'s infrastructure does not need more than static hosting, this is suitable for now and secure  
**PULPNET** is our other longterm WIP project [pulpjuice.net](https://pulpjuice.net), this will be locally hosted on a Linux server, open source repo can be found [here](https://github/ryankdaly/pulpnet)
